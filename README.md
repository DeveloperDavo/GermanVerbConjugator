### German Verb Conjugator

*This is the very first project I completed in Java (late 2015)*

This aim of this project is to apply what I have learned in "Introduction to Programming in Java (MIT)" and the "Java^TM Tutorial"

The German Verb Conjugator teaches users how to conjugate German verbs. Click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjugation) for more information on grammatical conjugation and [here](http://conjugator.reverso.net/conjugation-german.html) to compare the accuracy of the program.

**Features:**
- Displays a list of available verbs
- Prompts the user to choose a verb
- The verb is conjugated in the present and the perfect past tense
- The conjugated verb is then displayed
