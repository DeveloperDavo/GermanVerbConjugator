### German Verb Conjugator

*This is the very first project I completed in Java (late 2015)*

This aim of this project is to apply what I have learned in "Introduction to Programming in Java (MIT)" and the "Java^TM Tutorial"

The German Verb Conjugator teaches users how to conjugate German verbs. (Click [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjugation) for more information on grammatical conjugation and [here] (http://conjugator.reverso.net/conjugation-german.html) to compare the accuracy of the program) 

**Features:**
- Displays a list of available verbs
- Prompts the user to choose a verb
- The verb is conjugated in the present and the perfect past tense
- The conjugated verb is then displayed

**Possible Future Additions:**
- List of available verbs as file input (file I/O)
- Account for ä, ö , ü, ß
- Account for verbs that have a verb trunk ending in 't' (eg antworten)
- Add other tenses
- Add "sein"
- Add modal verbs
- Add irregular verbs
- Test the user
    - Randomise the questions
    - Reprompt the user if the conjugation is incorrect
- Introduce TTD
- Create a database of regular verbs
    - Prompt the user for a verb (and make sure it is in the list)
- Make a GUI or an Android app!
